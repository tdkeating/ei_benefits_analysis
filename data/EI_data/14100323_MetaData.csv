5,"Due to the COVID-19 situation, many Canadians who were not employed and seeking income assistance between March 15 and September 26, 2020, were accessing Government of Canada benefit programs other than Employment Insurance, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). As a result, the Employment Insurance Statistics program was suspended between the March and September 2020 reference months. Data for this period were released on December 17, along with data for October 2020."
6,"Data in this table for the March to September reference months should be used with caution due to program implications over the COVID-19 period. For more information, please refer to the October 2020 reference month release of Employment Insurance Statistics."
